'''

Function used to exclude the additional files path created by xrdfs on Caltech Tier 2.

Parameters

txt_file (str): The name of the text file you want to correct the paths. Ex: a0.txt, a1.txt.

to_find (str): The cut of the name of the root file you want to remove. 
Ex: if your file name is  Jpsi_50to100_Dstar_DPS_13TeV_DR_22.root, then to_find is Jpsi_50to100_Dstar_DPS_13TeV_DR_.
